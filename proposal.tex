\section{Introduction}
Policymakers in the United States attempt to create economies that are robust to industry downturns. 
The success (or limitation) of new policies heavily relies on the data of business entities. 
Gaining accurate visibility into enabling economic directions, however, is a challenging task because a large number of `microbusinesses'', defined as businesses with ten or fewer employees, are often too small or too new to be included in standard data sources.
To overcome this challenge, the Venture Forward team at GoDaddy has studied tens of millions of microbusinesses in the United States for several years and has made the survey data publicly available. 
Thus, using data science techniques will enable policy leaders to gain more insights, which will be helpful for microbusiness entrepreneurs. 
This competition serves as a platform for participants to broaden the economic impact. 

% Briefly introduce your task in the selected challenge. What is the input and what is the output?
% Getting to know your data. How large is it? What is the type of your data (categorical, numerical, etc)? 
% Are there any network, text or image data included?

\section{Method}
% How do you plan to solve it? Explain your idea at a high-level. (You may revise it or even propose a completely new one later. We just need to know that you have already spent some time thinking about it.)
% List at least 2 baseline approaches you would like to compare with. Add citations if they are from research papers.

\section{Timeline}
% A timeline that specifies your plan to finish the course project.
% Argue on the feasibility to finish the task on the selected challenge. If your framework is too complicated, you might struggle to implement it. Feel free to use existing tools and packages (e.g., repositories on GitHub).
